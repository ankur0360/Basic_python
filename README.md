# Basic_py
In that Program I used only the basic functionality of python .You don't need to  much knowledge to understand this .
                       
                       There I used 'def',it is used for to create user defined function 
                       All of the user defined function is void type,beacause any fuunction does not returns no value.

                       There are some global variable and local variable .
                              E.g- 1)  line[27] here 'a' is a global variable ,beacause we can access the variable across all functions
                                   2)  line[31] here 'usrid' is a local varible,,beacause we can access the variable only for the 'user()' function (line[29]).   

                       We use 'lower()' function.
                              It is used to convert any string to lower string.(line[50])
                              For e.g= 1) input=ANKUR
                                          output=ankur
                                       2) input=AnKUr
                                          output=ankur

                       We use 'not in' operator.
                              it is used to check the presence of a specified value inside in a given sequence , but it's return value is opposite.(line[55])





# There are some uses of loop,append,pop,etc. I think we are more familiar with this.
